# DevOps Principles for Backend Developers

## Introduction

This repository contains materials from a DevOps bootcamp originally designed for backend application developers. The bootcamp's primary goal was to introduce developers to the principles of application operations without focusing heavily on specific tools. 

As the instructor of this bootcamp at my previous companies, I aimed to bridge the gap between development and operations, despite not being a part of the operations team myself. This unique perspective allowed me to tailor the content specifically for developers, emphasizing concepts and practices rather than tool-specific implementations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to:

1. Document and preserve the knowledge shared during the bootcamp
2. Make the content accessible to a wider audience of backend developers
3. Provide a resource for companies and individuals looking to introduce DevOps principles to their development teams

## Target Audience

This bootcamp material is primarily designed for:

- Backend application developers
- Software engineers looking to expand their knowledge of operations
- Teams transitioning to a DevOps culture

While the content is tailored for backend developers, it can be valuable for anyone interested in understanding the principles of DevOps and application operations.

## Content Overview

The bootcamp covers the following key areas:

1. Code of conduct and pre-requisites
2. [Origin of DevOps](Origin.md)
3. Readme as tool for collaboration
4. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
6. Monitoring and Logging
7. Scalability and High Availability
8. Security in DevOps
9. Containerization and Orchestration Concepts
10. Incident Response and Postmortems

Each section focuses on principles and best practices rather than specific tools, allowing the concepts to be applied across various technology stacks and environments.
