# Exercise 9: Implementing Monitoring and Logging

## Objective
Enhance your scalable and highly available application from Exercise 8 by implementing comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions.

## Prerequisites
- Completed Exercise 8 (Scalability and High Availability)
- Basic understanding of monitoring and logging concepts

## Instructions

1. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Choose a monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, cloud provider's monitoring service)
   - Install and configure the monitoring tool in your cloud environment
   - Set up the following monitors:
     - CPU and memory usage for all instances
     - Network I/O
     - Application-specific metrics (e.g., request rate, error rate)
     - Database performance metrics

2. **Implement Logging**
   - Choose a logging solution (e.g., ELK stack, cloud provider's logging service)
   - Configure your application to generate structured logs
   - Set up log aggregation to collect logs from all instances
   - Implement log rotation and retention policies

3. **Create Dashboards**
   - Design and create dashboards in your monitoring tool to visualize:
     - Overall system health
     - Application performance metrics
     - Resource utilization
     - Key business metrics

4. **Set Up Alerting**
   - Configure alerts for critical issues, such as:
     - High CPU or memory usage
     - Elevated error rates
     - Unusual patterns in application metrics
   - Set up notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, Slack)

5. **Implement Distributed Tracing**
   - Choose a distributed tracing solution (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin)
   - Instrument your application to generate trace data
   - Set up trace collection and visualization

6. **Update Your Infrastructure as Code**
   - Modify your Terraform templates to include the new monitoring and logging resources
   - Ensure all instances are automatically configured to send logs and metrics

7. **Test Your Monitoring and Logging Setup**
   - Simulate various scenarios (high load, errors, etc.) and verify that they are correctly captured in your monitoring and logging systems
   - Test your alerting configuration

8. **Document Your Monitoring and Logging Architecture**
   - Create a document detailing your monitoring and logging setup, including:
     - Tools used and their purposes
     - Key metrics and logs being collected
     - Alerting rules and escalation procedures
     - How to access and use the dashboards

## Bonus Tasks
1. Implement log-based metrics
2. Set up anomaly detection using machine learning
3. Create a runbook for common issues, linked to your monitoring alerts

## Deliverables
1. Updated Terraform templates including monitoring and logging resources
2. Screenshots of your monitoring dashboards
3. Sample log queries for common troubleshooting scenarios
4. Documentation of your monitoring and logging architecture

Remember, effective monitoring and logging are crucial for maintaining and troubleshooting your application in production. They provide visibility into your system's behavior and help you respond quickly to issues.
