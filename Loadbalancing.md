# Load Balancing

Load balancing is a critical component in scalable and highly available systems. It involves distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, thus improving responsiveness and availability of applications.

## Key Concepts

1. **Types of Load Balancers**
   - Hardware Load Balancers
   - Software Load Balancers
   - DNS Load Balancing

2. **Load Balancing Algorithms**
   - Round Robin
   - Least Connections
   - IP Hash
   - Weighted Round Robin
   - Least Response Time

3. **Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancing**
   - Layer 4 (Transport Layer): Based on IP address and port
   - Layer 7 (Application Layer): Can make routing decisions based on application-specific data

4. **Health Checks**
   - Active health checks
   - Passive health checks

5. **Session Persistence**
   - Sticky sessions
   - Session replication

## Benefits of Load Balancing

- Improved application availability
- Increased scalability
- Enhanced security
- Flexibility in infrastructure changes

## Common Load Balancing Solutions

- Nginx
- HAProxy
- AWS Elastic Load Balancing
- Google Cloud Load Balancing
- Azure Load Balancer

Remember, effective load balancing is crucial for maintaining high performance and availability in distributed systems.
