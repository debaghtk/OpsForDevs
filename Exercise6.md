# Exercise 6: Cloud Deployment with Infrastructure as Code and Advanced Configuration

## Objective
Extend your local deployment from Exercise 5 to a cloud environment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and either Helm for Kubernetes package management or Chef for configuration management. Deploy your application to a cloud provider of your choice, setting up a basic production-like environment.

## Prerequisites
- Completed Exercise 5 (Local Deployment)
- An account with a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Basic understanding of cloud services and IaC concepts

## Instructions

1. **Choose a Cloud Provider and IaC Tool**
   - Cloud Providers: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
   - IaC Tool: Terraform

2. **Define Your Infrastructure with Terraform**
   Create Terraform templates to define:
   - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or equivalent
   - Subnets (public and private)
   - Security Groups
   - Compute instances (e.g., EC2, Compute Engine)
   - Managed Database service (e.g., RDS, Cloud SQL)

3. **Containerize Your Application**
   - Ensure your application is properly containerized
   - Push your container image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR)

4. **Choose Your Configuration Path**
   Select either Path A (Helm with Kubernetes) or Path B (Chef) for the next steps.

### Path A: Helm with Kubernetes

A1. **Set Up Kubernetes Cluster**
    - Use Terraform to create a managed Kubernetes cluster (e.g., EKS, GKE, AKS)

A2. **Create Helm Charts**
    - Create a Helm chart for your application
    - Include necessary Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, etc.)
    - Configure your chart to connect to the managed database service

A3. **Deploy with Helm**
    - Use Helm to deploy your application to the Kubernetes cluster

A4. **Implement Continuous Deployment**
    - Extend your CI/CD pipeline to:
      - Build and push your container image
      - Update your Helm chart version
      - Deploy to your Kubernetes cluster using Helm

### Path B: Chef

B1. **Set Up Chef Workstation**
    - Install Chef Workstation on your local machine
    - Set up a Chef repository for your project

B2. **Create Chef Cookbooks**
    - Write Chef cookbooks to configure your servers
    - Include recipes for:
      - Installing necessary software
      - Configuring your application
      - Setting up connections to the database

B3. **Set Up a Chef Server or use Chef Zero**
    - Either set up a Chef Server or use Chef Zero for a serverless approach

B4. **Apply Chef Configurations**
    - Use Chef to apply your cookbooks to the servers

B5. **Implement Continuous Deployment**
    - Extend your CI/CD pipeline to:
      - Build and push your container image
      - Update and apply Chef cookbooks

5. **Verify Deployment**
   - Access your application
   - Verify that your application is connecting to the managed database

6. **Clean Up**
   - Create scripts to tear down your infrastructure to avoid unnecessary costs

## Bonus Tasks
1. Set up a staging environment in addition to production
2. Implement a simple update strategy (rolling updates for Kubernetes or blue-green for Chef)

## Deliverables
1. Terraform templates for your cloud infrastructure
2. Helm charts (Path A) or Chef cookbooks (Path B)
3. Updated CI/CD pipeline configuration
4. Screenshots or logs showing:
   - Successful cloud deployment
   - Application running in the cloud
5. Brief documentation including:
   - Your cloud architecture diagram
   - Deployment process

Remember, this exercise focuses on setting up a basic production-like environment in the cloud using Infrastructure as Code and either Helm or Chef for advanced configuration management.
