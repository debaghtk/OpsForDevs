# Exercise 1: Creating a README for Your Project

## Objective
Create a README for a project of your choice using the elements of a good README outlined below.

## Instructions
1. Choose a project you're familiar with or create a new one.
2. Write a README.md file for this project.
3. Include clear and concise instructions for setting up the project locally.

## Example: Project Setup Instructions

Here's an example of how you might structure the setup instructions in your README:

1. Install Go version 1.16 or later:
   ```bash
   wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   ```

2. Install PostgreSQL 13:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install postgresql-13
   ```

3. Install Redis 6.0:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:redislabs/redis
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install redis
   ```

4. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   go mod download
   ```

5. Set up the database and start the application:
   ```bash
   psql -c "CREATE DATABASE yourproject"
   redis-server &
   go run main.go
   ```

## Additional Sections to Include

### Running Tests

Provide instructions on how to run tests for your project. For example:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Activate your virtual environment (if applicable):
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install test dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-test.txt
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

### Running the Application

Include steps to run your application locally. For example:

1. Ensure you're in your project directory with your virtual environment activated.

2. Install application dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set necessary environment variables:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
   export API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Or if using a WSGI server like Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   gunicorn app:app
   ```

Remember, these are examples. Tailor your README to your specific project's needs and technologies.
