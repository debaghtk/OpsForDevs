# DevOps Bootcamp: Best Practices for Participants

To maximize your learning experience and contribute to a productive environment, please adhere to the following best practices:

1. **Ask Smart Questions**: Before seeking help, attempt to solve the problem yourself. When asking questions, ensure they are well-researched and thoughtful. Refer to Eric Steven Raymond's guide:
   [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

2. **Search Before Asking**: Always search the web for solutions to problems you encounter. Many common issues have already been solved and documented by the community.

3. **Read the Manual (RTFM)**: Familiarize yourself with the documentation of the tools and technologies we're using. Often, the answer to your question is in the manual.

4. **Debug with Logs**: When troubleshooting, always check and analyze relevant logs. Logs are crucial for understanding system behavior and can often point directly to the source of a problem.
